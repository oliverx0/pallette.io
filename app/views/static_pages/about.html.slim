          p.content-normal I like defining myself as a dedicated, enthusiastic and entrepreneurial-minded software engineer who loves product design and makes data driven decisions. I have a B.S in Computer Science and I am currently pursuing a M.S in Information Systems with a specialization in Connective Media at Cornell Tech.


          p.content-normal For as long as I can remember, I have been passionate about technology and its power to bring people together. This is the reason I decided to jump right into a masterâ€™s degree which would provide me with the necessary skills to succeed in the Connective Media landscape. I enjoy solving technical challenges and I am not picky about a specific programming language or framework to make things happen.

            b.second-title I enjoy solving real-world problems

          p.content-normal During the past 6 years, I have had the opportunity to learn about the core theories behind computer science and software engineering. From the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms to different engineering methodologies such as waterfall and agile, I have come to understand that there is not one specific tool or way to solve any given challenge. In that sense, I like ideating scalable and robust solutions that will evolve as challenges do.

          p.content-normal At Cornell Tech, I have been able to put all these theories into practice, by teaming up with incredibly smart individuals who are able to bring out the best in me. I have worked on a variety of projects that go from the creation of a tongue-controlled wireless device to empower people with quadriplegia to become more independent, to the implementation of a parallel processing API in C.

            b.second-title How & Why I work

          p.content-normal I am passionate about building products that make an impact in other people's lives. I enjoy working with diverse teams in which their members complement and learn from each other. Most importantly though, I love working in an environment were creativity is embraced.

          ul.content-normal
            li
              b I like moving fast.
              = " I use rapid-prototypying as a way to quickly show ideas to people and iterate based on their feedback. Since ideas are cheaper to change, I don't commit to any specific feature but just work on getting something off the ground as fast as possible. It is the easiest way to get validation."
            li
              b I love pair programming.
              = " It requires a lot of practice, but once two coders 'synch', they become unstoppable. The more people can be critical about the way I work, the more I get to learn in the process."

            li
              b I enjoy improving the user experience behind the products I build.
              = " Design cannot be left to designers alone. I believe that any person involved in the creation of a product has to be concerned with its design."

            li
              b I am very organized.
              = " Making sure that everything is going according to plan is a priority for me. However, I also know when to improvise and make the best out of chaos."

            b.second-title What excites me

          p.content-normal I am constantly learning about new techniques and technologies to get things done. The themes that I am the most motivated about are:

          ul.content-normal
            li
              b Disruptive Technology.
              = " The idea of defying the status quo and making an important breakthrough with technology is something I am very excited about. I want to learn more about Virtual and Augmented Reality, 3D printing, Internet of Things, etc. Currently, I am working on a tongue-controlled wireless device that will (hopefully) disrupt the market for mobility products aimed at people with disabilities."
            li
              b Connective Media.
              = " The convergence of communication, information, and media. Since the solutions in this realm involve not only technology but also business, design and social sciences, it is a very interesting field where I get to be creative. I enjoy working on products and services that bring people together."

            li
              b Entrepreneurship.
              = " I love reading about the journey of successful entrepreneurs and understanding what makes products stand out. I am fascinated by the theories behind the lean startup, MVPs, prototyping, company culture, 'fake it till you make it', convincing VCs to invest, etc."

            li
              b Traveling.
              = " I have been fortunate enough to live in 4 different countries (Venezuela, Spain, Germany and the U.S) and traveled to other 12. This experience has given me a unique multicultural perspective that can be applied when solving any kind of problem."
